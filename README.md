### App Title:  Muzipedia

## Overview

Music fans worldwide have easy access to full biographies of their favorite artists on Wikipedia, and videographies available on Youtube, but there rarely exists a happy medium for the individual looking to find a concise and eclectic way to gather information on a single artist without visiting multiple destinations.

### Meet Muzipedia

Muzipedia is your one-stop search engine for melding multiple aspects into a single musical artist search query.  You can enter any artist's name and hit the 'Go!' button where then our servers work to collect you the best set of data which we then display in a colorful yet modern way that is easy to read, navigate, and explore.
